# Book Club

## Brief
As part of a new years resolution, I'm trying to read one book per month. To help me on my way, I built this site as an excuse to show off the books as well as some new learning in jQuery + CSS.

## Links
- Live: https://ruairiconway.github.io/book-club/
- Code: https://github.com/ruairiconway/book-club

## Highlights
- Site renders based on object array library.js (where all the book details are stored).
- HTML structure is generated dynamically depending on user interactions or data type.
- Form to share recommendations is fully functional using Formspree. https://formspree.io/
- Renders the current months book on load.
- Users can navigate using scroll, swipe, or arrows keys for accessibility.
- Included Hammer.js plugin to aid with mobile interaction. https://hammerjs.github.io/

## Future Edits
- Debug mobile display cutting off on chrome & safari. Works well on Firefox.
- Fix arrow navigation
- Add in UI indication to scroll up or down as a prompt
- Add in remaining books to library.js
- Change book description so that on mobile it's collapsed and can be toggled via a button at the bottom of the screen. Giving more focus to the book artwork, and keeping the small screens cleaner.
